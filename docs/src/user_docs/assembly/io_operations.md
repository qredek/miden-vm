## Input / output operations
Miden assembly provides a set of instructions for moving data between the operand stack and several other sources. These sources include:

* **Program code**: values to be moved onto the operand stack can be hard-coded in a program's source code.
* **Environment**: values can be moved onto the operand stack from environment variables. These include current clock cycle, current stack depth, and a few others.
* **Advice provider**: values can be moved onto the operand stack from the advice provider by popping them from the advice stack (see more about the advice provider [here](../../intro/overview.md#nondeterministic-inputs)). The VM can also inject new data into the advice provider via *advice injector* instructions.
* **Memory**: values can be moved between the stack and random-access memory. The memory is word-addressable, meaning, four elements are located at each address, and we can read and write elements to/from memory in batches of four. Memory can be accessed via absolute memory references (i.e., via memory addresses) as well as via local procedure references (i.e., local index). The latter approach ensures that a procedure does not access locals of another procedure.

### Constant inputs

| Instruction                                                               | Stack_input | Stack_output                                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| push.*a* <br> - *(1-2 cycles)* <br> push.*a*.*b* <br> push.*a*.*b*.*c*... | [ ... ]     | [a, ... ] <br> [b, a, ... ] <br> [c, b, a, ... ] | Pushes values $a$, $b$, $c$ etc. onto the stack. Up to $16$ values can be specified. All values must be valid field elements in decimal (e.g., $123$) or hexadecimal (e.g., $0x7b$) representation. |

When specifying values in hexadecimal format, it is possible to omit the periods between individual values as long as total number of specified bytes is a multiple of $8$. That is, the following are semantically equivalent:

```
push.0x1234.0xabcd
push.0x0000000000001234000000000000abcd
```
In both case the values must still encode valid field elements.

### Nondeterministic inputs

As mentioned above, nondeterministic inputs are provided to the VM via the advice provider. Instructs which access the advice provider fall into two categories. The first category consists of instructions which move data from the advice stack onto the operand stack and/or memory.

| Instruction                      | Stack_input        | Stack_output        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| adv_push.*n* <br> - *(n cycles)* | [ ... ]            | [a, ... ]           | $a \leftarrow stack.pop()$ <br> Pops $n$ values from the advice stack and pushes them onto the operand stack. Valid for $n \in \{1, ..., 16\}$. <br> Fails if the advice stack has fewer than $n$ values.                                                                                                                |
| adv_loadw <br> - *(1 cycle)*     | [0, 0, 0, 0, ... ] | [A, ... ]           | $A \leftarrow stack.pop(4)$ <br> Pop the next word (4 elements) from the advice stack and overwrites the first word of the operand stack (4 elements) with them. <br> Fails if the advice stack has fewer than $4$ values.                                                                                               |
| adv_pipe <br> - *(1 cycle)*      | [C, B, A, a, ... ] | [E, D, A, a', ... ] | $[D, E] \leftarrow [adv\_stack.pop(4), adv\_stack.pop(4)]$ <br> $a' \leftarrow a + 2$ <br> Pops the next two words from the advice stack, overwrites the top of the operand stack with them and also writes these words into memory at address $a$ and $a + 1$.<br> Fails if the advice stack has fewer than $8$ values. |

> **Note**: The opcodes above always push data onto the operand stack so that the first element is placed deepest in the stack. For example, if the data on the stack is `a,b,c,d` and you use the opcode `adv_push.4`, the data will be `d,c,b,a` on your stack. This is also the behavior of the other opcodes.

The second category injects new data into the advice provider. These operations are called *advice injectors* and they affect only the advice provider state. That is, the state of all other VM components (e.g., stack, memory) are unaffected. Executing advice injectors does not consume any VM cycles (i.e., these instructions are executed in $0$ cycles).

Advice injectors fall into two categories: (1) injectors which push new data onto the advice stack, and (2) injectors which insert new data into the advice map.

### Random access memory

 As mentioned above, there are two ways to access memory in Miden VM. The first way is via memory addresses using the instructions listed below. The addresses are absolute - i.e., they don't depend on the procedure context. Memory addresses can be in the range $[0, 2^{32})$.

Memory is guaranteed to be initialized to zeros. Thus, when reading from memory address which hasn't been written to previously, zero elements will be returned.

| Instruction                                                              | Stack_input           | Stack_output        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If $a$ is provided via the stack, it is removed from the stack first. <br> Fails if $a \ge 2^{32}$                                                |

The second way to access memory is via procedure locals using the instructions listed below. These instructions are available only in procedure context. The number of locals available to a given procedure must be specified at [procedure declaration](./code_organization.md#procedures) time, and trying to access more locals than was declared will result in a compile-time error. The number of locals per procedure is not limited, but the total number of locals available to all procedures at runtime must be smaller than $2^{32}$.

Unlike regular memory, procedure locals are not guaranteed to be initialized to zeros. Thus, when working with locals, one must assume that before a local memory address has been written to, it contains "garbage".

Internally in the VM, procedure locals are stored at memory offset stating at $2^{30}$. Thus, every procedure local has an absolute address in regular memory. The `locaddr.i` instruction is provided specifically to map an index of a procedure's local to an absolute address so that it can be passed to downstream procedures, when needed.
